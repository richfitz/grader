Title: Numerical Derivatives
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Calculates numerical derivatives.  This code is heavily
  inspired by numDeriv, but optimised for the situation where
  functions can accept vector valued arguments, support for rescaling
  to compute derivatives on a log scale, and eventually things like
  non-centred differences for functions that have discontinuities.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
